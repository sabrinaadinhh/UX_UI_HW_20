          <p class="lead">The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians Economic Development Corporation helps to create economic opportunities for Tribes of the Pacific Northwest and individual tribal members through business loans. By supporting local entrepreneurs, ATNI-EDC aims to create jobs and build wealth within tribal communities.</p>
          <h2 class="problem">Problem</h2>
          <p class="problem">We have observed that many people feel unequipped and overwhelmed when going through the loan application process due to the large amount of information and lack of clear definitions. As it stands, ATNI-EDC's form provides no guidance on their loan application process.</p>
          <h2 class="solution">Solution</h2>
          <p class="solution">We believe that creating a simple and easy-to-understand loan application process will help to develop financial literacy and expand economic opportunities within Native American communities in the Pacific Northwest, as well as make ATNI-EDC a more prolific loan servicer amongst Native entrepreneurs</p>

                <p>We started off the design process by creating a  journey map to emulate what emotions our users would feel when trying to apply for a loan. We wanted to really try to put ourselves in the users’ shoes so that we make the new design more user-friendly.</p>

            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <p>Afterwards, we started to throw in ideas and sketches on how to redesign the website layout. We wanted the design to be pleasing to the eye and less confusing to users.</p>

                <p>We conducted user interviews to see what feedback users had in regards to the new design that we had illustrated for the website. For each interview, we had the users complete 4 different tasks: Find out what ANTI is & what they do, Look for job openings at ATNI, Find out more information about how to apply for a loan, and Arrive at the loan application page. We asked the users their thoughts throughout the duration of the interviews.</p>

                    We appreciated the time that we had spent together redesigning the ATNI-EDC. Each member played a key role in getting the project done. We really enjoyed working together as a group as we kept each other in check - we always checked up on each other’s progress for each section. Each member enjoyed being able to put in their creative ideas for the design of the website.

                  <p>* Create more financial education pages to help educate users on different types of loans</p>
